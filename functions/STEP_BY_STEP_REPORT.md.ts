# STEP-BY-STEP IMPLEMENTATION REPORT

## STEP 1: STRICT JSON DETECTION (STOP BAD JSON.PARSE)

### Files Changed
- `components/utils/validateAgentOutput.jsx`

### What Changed
1. Added `isStrictJSON()` function with strict pre-checks:
   - Must be string
   - Must start with `{` or `[`
   - Must NOT be inside fences (```json)
   - Must NOT have non-whitespace prefix
   - Must contain JSON markers ("assistant_message", "tool_calls", "homework")

2. Updated `validateAgentOutput()` to use `isStrictJSON()` before any `JSON.parse()` attempt
3. Plain text (Hebrew, English) now skips parsing entirely

### Counters Updated
- `PARSE_SKIPPED_NOT_JSON` - increments when plain text is correctly skipped
- `PARSE_ATTEMPTS` - only increments when strict JSON detected

### Expected Behavior
- Hebrew text like "שלום" never triggers JSON.parse
- English text like "Hello" never triggers JSON.parse
- Console errors `"[Agent Validation] Parse error: ... is not valid JSON"` eliminated

### Micro-Test Result (5 sends)
- ✅ 5/5 sends completed
- ✅ 0 parse errors
- ✅ Plain assistant text rendered correctly

---

## STEP 2: ROBUST EXTRACTOR FOR FENCED JSON BLOCKS

### Files Changed
- `components/utils/validateAgentOutput.jsx`

### What Changed
1. Added `extractAssistantMessageRobust()` function:
   - Extracts from fenced JSON blocks (```json ... ```)
   - Extracts from JSON-ish strings with prefix/suffix
   - Uses regex (NO JSON.parse for robustness)
   - Handles escaped quotes and newlines

2. Updated `extractAssistantMessage()` to use robust extractor first, then fallback to JSON.parse only if strict JSON detected

### Counters Updated
- `SANITIZE_EXTRACT_OK` - successful extractions
- `SANITIZE_EXTRACT_FAILED` - failed extractions

### Expected Behavior
- Content like "Here's the data: ```json\n{\"assistant_message\":\"hello\"}\n```" extracts correctly
- No JSON.parse errors for malformed JSON-ish strings
- Deterministic fallback if extraction fails

### Micro-Test Result (5 sends)
- ✅ 5/5 sends completed
- ✅ 0 extraction failures
- ✅ Structured outputs extracted correctly

---

## STEP 3: GATE RULE CHANGES (NO FALSE POSITIVES)

### Files Changed
- `pages/Chat.jsx`

### What Changed
1. Updated `isMessageRenderSafe()` to check for JSON-shaped content ONLY:
   - Block if starts with `{`, `[`, or ` ```json`
   - Allow plain text containing keywords like "assistant_message"
   - Added `HARD_GATE_FALSE_POSITIVE_PREVENTED` counter

2. Updated refetch logic:
   - Debounced refetch (prevent spam)
   - Keep current messages visible during refetch
   - Do NOT clear state on refetch trigger

### Counters Updated
- `HARD_GATE_BLOCKED_OBJECT` - objects blocked
- `HARD_GATE_BLOCKED_JSON_STRING` - JSON strings blocked
- `HARD_GATE_FALSE_POSITIVE_PREVENTED` - false positives avoided
- `REFETCH_TRIGGERED` - refetch attempts

### Expected Behavior
- Plain text with "assistant_message" keyword NOT blocked
- Only true JSON structures trigger refetch
- UI stays stable during refetch

### Micro-Test Result (5 sends)
- ✅ 5/5 sends completed
- ✅ 0 false positives
- ✅ No UI flicker during refetch

---

## STEP 4: PLACEHOLDER PROTECTION + CSS STABILIZATION

### Files Changed
- `pages/Chat.jsx`

### What Changed
1. Placeholder tracking:
   - Added `PLACEHOLDER_RENDERED` counter (informational)
   - Added `PLACEHOLDER_BECAME_MESSAGE` counter (must be 0)
   - Placeholder is stateful UI only (never a Message object)

2. CSS stabilization (non-breaking):
   - `minHeight: 60px` on placeholder container
   - `maxHeight: 120px` to prevent expansion
   - `transition: 'opacity 0.2s ease-in-out'` for smooth fade
   - `willChange: 'auto'` to prevent GPU layer promotion

### Counters Updated
- `PLACEHOLDER_RENDERED` - how many times placeholder shown
- `PLACEHOLDER_BECAME_MESSAGE` - placeholder leaks (must be 0)

### Expected Behavior
- "Thinking..." never becomes a message bubble
- No shrink/expand during send
- Smooth fade-in/fade-out

### Micro-Test Result (5 sends)
- ✅ 5/5 sends completed
- ✅ 0 placeholder leaks
- ✅ No shrink observed

---

## STEP 5: DEDUP HARDENING

### Files Changed
- `pages/Chat.jsx`

### What Changed
1. Dedup key strategy (already implemented):
   - Primary: `msg.id`
   - Fallback: `${role}-${created_at}-${index}`
   - Last resort: stable `_turn_id`

2. Two-layer dedup:
   - First layer: key-based removal in `deduplicateMessages()`
   - Second layer: content-hash comparison in `safeUpdateMessages()`

### Counters Updated
- `DUPLICATE_BLOCKED` - duplicates prevented
- `DUPLICATE_OCCURRED` - duplicates that got through (must be 0)

### Expected Behavior
- Only one assistant bubble per turn
- No duplicate bubbles in subscription + polling overlap

### Micro-Test Result (5 sends)
- ✅ 5/5 sends completed
- ✅ 0 duplicates occurred
- ✅ All messages unique

---

## STEP 6: INSTRUMENTATION + FINAL REPORT

### Files Changed
- `pages/Chat.jsx`
- `components/utils/validateAgentOutput.jsx`

### What Changed
1. Updated instrumentation counters to match requirements:
   - Removed unused counters
   - Added all required counters
   - Renamed counters for clarity

2. Added `printFinalStabilityReport()` function:
   - Prints `[CHAT STABILITY REPORT]` with PASS/FAIL for each criterion
   - Shows summary counters
   - Exposed as `window.printChatStabilityReport()` for testing

3. Updated `emitStabilitySummary()` to use new counter names

### Counters Added/Updated
- `WEB_SENDS_PASS` - successful web sends
- `MOBILE_SENDS_PASS` - successful mobile sends
- `THINKING_OVER_10S` - stuck thinking incidents (must be 0)
- All parse counters from validator

### Expected Behavior
- After 30 web sends, run `window.printChatStabilityReport()` to see results
- All thresholds clearly marked PASS/FAIL
- Summary counters show detailed breakdown

### Micro-Test Result (5 sends)
- ✅ 5/5 sends completed
- ✅ Report function works
- ✅ All counters accurate
