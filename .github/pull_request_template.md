## Assertion Quality Reviewer Checklist
<!-- Complete this section when this PR adds, modifies, or removes any E2E or unit test assertion. Otherwise delete it. -->
- [ ] Did this PR weaken any existing assertion? If yes, is the reason documented with artifact evidence?
- [ ] Does each new or modified assertion still prove the intended behavior (not just text presence)?
- [ ] Did this PR replace behavior validation (DOM state, data-testid, attribute) with text-only validation?
- [ ] Did this PR add `test.skip` or `test.fixme` to any committed test?
- [ ] Does the PR description still accurately reflect the final diff?

> **Reminder:** A failing test is a signal — fix the root cause, not the assertion.
> See `docs/copilot-pr-workflow.md` §12 for the full Playwright / E2E guardrails.
