 *
 * Therapist Upgrade — Stage 2 Phase 3 — Workflow Engine
 *
 * This module defines the upgraded therapist workflow engine: the fixed
 * 6-step response sequence, the response-shaping rules, the emotion
 * differentiation map, and the instruction builder used for context injection.
 *
 * ISOLATION GUARANTEE
 * -------------------
 * Nothing in this module imports from or affects the current default therapist
 * path (CBT_THERAPIST_WIRING_HYBRID).  This module is referenced only by
 * CBT_THERAPIST_WIRING_STAGE2_V2 and the Phase 3 routing branch in
 * src/api/activeAgentWiring.js.  When THERAPIST_UPGRADE_WORKFLOW_ENABLED is
 * false (the default), this module is never invoked.
 *
 * SAFETY COMPATIBILITY
 * --------------------
 * All workflow instructions are additive context that shape response structure.
 * They do NOT replace, weaken, or bypass the existing safety stack
 * (postLlmSafetyFilter, sanitizeAgentOutput, sanitizeConversation,
 * enhancedCrisisDetector, risk panel flow).  Any existing safety signal always
 * takes precedence over workflow state.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE MUST NOT DO
 * ----------------------------
 * - Alter the default therapist path in any way
 * - Introduce retrieval, live sources, or external knowledge
 * - Add session-write or session-tracking side effects
 * - Override existing crisis handling or risk-panel behavior
 * - Weaken any existing safety filter
 *
