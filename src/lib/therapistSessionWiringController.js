/**
 * @file src/lib/therapistSessionWiringController.js
 *
 * Phase 0.2A — Session-local therapist wiring controller.
 *
 * Provides a small, testable, session-scoped object that:
 *   1. Holds a candidate therapist wiring (initially the build-time fallback).
 *   2. Accepts a runtime authority decision before the first session-start send.
 *   3. Locks the effective wiring the moment the first session-start/send consumes it.
 *   4. Rejects late-arriving runtime snapshots after the lock so the therapist
 *      identity/capability cannot switch in the middle of an active session.
 *
 * SESSION LOCK RULE (from spec):
 *   Once the first therapist session-start/send consumes the effective wiring,
 *   that wiring is LOCKED for the current Chat page/session.  A late-arriving
 *   runtime snapshot MUST NOT switch therapist wiring in the middle of an
 *   active page/session.
 *
 * FAIL-OPEN RULE:
 *   If the first therapist send occurs before the runtime snapshot is ready:
 *   - use the existing build-time fallback wiring
 *   - lock it
 *   - do NOT block the send
 *
 * COMPANION ISOLATION:
 *   This controller is used only for the CBT Therapist agent.
 *   Companion wiring is completely independent and must not be routed here.
