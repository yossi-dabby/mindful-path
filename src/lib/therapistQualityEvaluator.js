 *
 * Therapist Upgrade — Wave 5A / Wave 5B — Quality Evaluator (Scaffold + Feature Extractor)
 *
 * PURPOSE
 * -------
 * Wave 5A: Pure deterministic scaffold that defines the Quality Evaluator contract:
 * dimensions, score bands, aggregate bands, fail-safe snapshot shape, and the
 * buildQualityEvaluatorSnapshot() factory.
 *
 * Wave 5B: Adds extractEvaluatorFeatures(inputs), a pure deterministic feature
 * extractor that normalises structured session-start signals into a stable
 * evaluator input contract for each active quality dimension.  No scoring logic
 * is applied in Wave 5B.  The extractor is inert: it is not called from any
 * runtime path and emits no diagnostics.
 *
 * Wave 5C: Adds the deterministic scoring engine.  buildQualityEvaluatorSnapshot()
 * now internally calls extractEvaluatorFeatures() and scores each of the 7 active
 * structural dimensions, derives a bounded aggregate band, and derives bounded
 * risk_flags from scored structural issues.  Everything remains inert: no runtime
 * call site, no diagnostics emission, no rollout gating.
 *
 * ISOLATION GUARANTEE
 * -------------------
 * This module has NO imports from any other app module. It does NOT import
 * from agentWiring, activeAgentWiring, featureFlags, workflowContextInjector,
 * or any entity definition.  It is a standalone, self-contained pure library.
 *
 * SAFETY CONTRACT
 * ---------------
 * - No LLM calls.
 * - No entity access.
 * - No async.
 * - No side effects.
 * - Deterministic only: same inputs always produce the same output.
 * - Fail-safe defaults: absent/null/malformed inputs → EVALUATOR_FAIL_SAFE_SNAPSHOT.
 * - No user-visible output.
 * - No control path over any runtime behaviour.
 * - No raw user text accepted by the scaffold API.
 * - All public exports are frozen plain objects or pure functions.
 * - All public functions never throw — they catch all exceptions and return
 *   the fail-safe snapshot.
 *
 * NOT WIRED YET (Wave 5A / Wave 5B / Wave 5C)
 * --------------------------------------------
 * - Not called from Chat.jsx.
 * - Not called from workflowContextInjector.js.
 * - Not emitting diagnostics.
 * - Not gated by QUALITY_EVALUATOR_FLAGS at runtime (flag added in featureFlags.js
 *   but this file does not import it; the evaluator is callable in isolation).
 * - Wave 5C scoring is inert: no runtime call site, no diagnostics emission,
 *   no rollout gating.  Runtime wiring belongs to Wave 5D.
 *
 * DIMENSIONS (Wave 5A — structural/objective only)
 * -------------------------------------------------
 * Only the most objective and structurally-verifiable dimensions are included
 * in the active first set. Softer/subjective dimensions are declared as deferred
 * placeholders with scoring intentionally omitted.
 *
 * Active dimensions:
 *   strategy_alignment          — Did the response align with the planned strategy mode?
 *   formulation_alignment       — Did the response respect the formulation context?
 *   continuity_alignment        — Did the response honour session-continuity signals?
 *   knowledge_alignment         — Did the response use retrieved knowledge appropriately?
 *   safety_escalation_consistency — Were safety signals handled consistently?
 *   role_boundary_integrity     — Did the response stay within the therapist role boundary?
 *   context_completeness        — Was the available context used (not ignored)?
 *
 * Deferred placeholders (declared but not scored in Wave 5A):
 *   genericness_risk            — Deferred: softer/subjective dimension, not scored yet.
 *   over_directiveness_risk     — Deferred: softer/subjective dimension, not scored yet.
 *
 * SCORE BANDS (per-dimension)
 * ---------------------------
 *   PASS   — dimension requirement satisfied
 *   WEAK   — dimension partially satisfied; below expected quality bar
 *   FAIL   — dimension requirement not met
 *   SKIP   — dimension not applicable for this session context
 *   UNKNOWN — evaluator could not determine a score (scaffold default for all)
 *
 * AGGREGATE BANDS (overall snapshot)
 * ------------------------------------
 *   STRONG   — All active dimensions are PASS or SKIP
 *   ADEQUATE — No FAIL; some WEAK; no UNKNOWN
 *   MARGINAL — One or more WEAK or UNKNOWN; no FAIL
 *   POOR     — One or more FAIL dimensions
 *   UNKNOWN  — Snapshot not evaluated (scaffold default)
 *   FAIL_SAFE — Returned when inputs are absent, null, or malformed

 *
 * SAFETY CONTRACT
 * ---------------
 * - Never throws. All exceptions return EVALUATOR_FAIL_SAFE_SNAPSHOT.
 * - No LLM calls, no entity access, no async, no side effects.
 * - No raw user text accepted: inputs must be pre-processed structured objects.
 * - Output is always a frozen plain object.
 *
 * INPUT CONTRACT
 * --------------
 * @param {object|null|undefined} inputs
 *   A bounded structured context object derived from session-start signals.
 *   Must be a non-null plain object with at least one recognised key to be
 *   treated as a valid (non-fail-safe) input. Raw user message text must NOT
 *   be passed as inputs; only pre-processed structured signals are accepted.
 *
 *   Recognised input keys (all optional, informational only in Wave 5A):
 *     strategyState       {object|null}  — Output of determineTherapistStrategy()
 *     formulationHints    {object|null}  — Bounded formulation context object
 *     continuitySignals   {object|null}  — Bounded continuity context signals
 *     knowledgePlan       {object|null}  — Output of planCBTKnowledgeRetrieval()
 *     safetyActive        {boolean}      — True when safety/containment is active
 *     ltsInputs           {object|null}  — Bounded LTS strategy inputs
 *

 *   - aggregate_band {string}             — one of EVALUATOR_AGGREGATE_BANDS values
 *   - is_fail_safe {boolean}              — true only for fail-safe/bad-inputs path
 *   - fail_safe_reason {string|null}      — non-null only on fail-safe path
 *   - dimensions {Record<string,string>}  — active dimension keys → score band
 *   - dimension_evidence {Record<string,string>} — active dimension keys → evidence label
 *   - risk_flags {string[]}               — bounded structural risk flag tokens
 *   - deferred_dimensions {string[]}      — deferred dimension keys (not yet scored)

 * ---------------
 * - Never throws. All exceptions return EVALUATOR_FEATURES_FAIL_SAFE.
 * - No raw user message text accepted or preserved.
 * - No LLM calls, no entity access, no async, no side effects.
