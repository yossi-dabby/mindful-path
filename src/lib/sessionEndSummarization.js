 *
 * Therapist Upgrade — Phase 2.1 — Real Session-End Invocation Path
 * Extended in Phase 4 — Chat.jsx Conversation Memory Write
 *
 * Phase 2.1 closes two gaps left open by Phase 2:
 *   1. There was no real, bounded session-end invocation path.
 *   2. The generateSessionSummary backend accepted only pre-shaped payloads;
 *      there was no step that derived structured output FROM session/conversation input.
 *
 * Phase 4 closes the Chat.jsx memory-write gap:
 *   3. Chat.jsx free-form therapy conversations had no path to write structured
 *      records to CompanionMemory, so the V7 cross-session continuity block read
 *      empty memory on every session start. Phase 4 adds a lightweight write path
 *      for Chat.jsx conversations, enabling V7 continuity to read prior session
 *      context in future sessions.
 *
 * This module provides:
 *   A. deriveSessionSummaryPayload(session, boundedMessages)
 *      — The ACTUAL summarization step. Takes a CoachingSession entity and a
 *        bounded conversation message window. Extracts structured, clinical data
 *        deterministically (non-LLM) from session metadata and action plan.
 *        Returns a payload matching the Phase 1 therapist-memory contract.
 *
 *   B. triggerSessionEndSummarization(session, messages, invoker)
 *      — The REAL INVOCATION PATH for CoachingSession completions. Checks
 *        isSummarizationEnabled(), derives the summary payload, then calls the
 *        generateSessionSummary backend function via base44.functions.invoke.
 *        Completely non-blocking (fire-and-forget). When flags are off it is
 *        entirely inert.
 *
 *   C. deriveConversationMemoryPayload(conversationId, conversationMeta)   [Phase 4]
 *      — Lightweight counterpart of deriveSessionSummaryPayload for Chat.jsx
 *        free-form therapy conversations. Derives a minimal therapist-memory
 *        record from conversation identity metadata (no message content stored).
 *        Produces a valid record matching the Phase 1 schema; session_summary
 *        is populated when a meaningful intent or name is available.
 *
 *   D. triggerConversationEndSummarization(conversationId, conversationMeta, invoker, entities)   [Phase 4/Phase 3]
 *      — Non-blocking, gated memory-write trigger for Chat.jsx conversation ends.
 *        Called from Chat.jsx's requestSummary function (the natural
 *        end-of-chat boundary). Gated by the same isSummarizationEnabled() check.
 *        Inert in default mode (flags off). Fail-closed.
 *        When `entities` is provided and THERAPIST_UPGRADE_CONTINUITY_ENABLED is
 *        active, the base payload is enriched with structured Goal and
 *        CaseFormulation data before persistence (Phase 3 enrichment).
 *
 *   E. enrichConversationMemoryPayload(basePayload, entities)   [Phase 3]
 *      — Asynchronously enriches a base Chat.jsx memory payload with structured
 *        data from the Goal and CaseFormulation entities (read-only).
 *        Populates goals_referenced (goal IDs), follow_up_tasks (active goal
 *        titles), and working_hypotheses (from CaseFormulation core_belief).
 *        Fail-closed: any entity read failure returns the unmodified basePayload.
 *        Only called when both isSummarizationEnabled() AND isContinuityEnabled().
 *
 * ACTIVATION
 * ----------
 * Gated by THERAPIST_UPGRADE_SUMMARIZATION_ENABLED (and master
 * THERAPIST_UPGRADE_ENABLED). Both flags default to false.
 * When flags are off, this module is imported safely but all trigger functions
 * return immediately without side effects.
 *
 * SESSION-END BOUNDARY (CoachingSession path)
 * -------------------------------------------
 * triggerSessionEndSummarization is called from CoachingChat.jsx when the
 * session stage transitions to 'completed' via updateStageMutation.onSuccess.
 * This is a real, bounded, explicit session-completion surface — it fires once
 * per stage transition, not on every message. It is non-blocking: the session
 * close UX is unaffected whether summarization succeeds or fails.
 *
 * CONVERSATION-END BOUNDARY (Chat.jsx path)   [Phase 4]
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * triggerConversationEndSummarization is called from Chat.jsx's requestSummary
 * function — the point where a user explicitly signals the end of a therapy
 * conversation. This is the natural end-of-chat boundary in the free-form
 * therapy interface. It fires once per requestSummary call, is non-blocking,
 * and the Chat.jsx UI is completely unaffected whether it succeeds or fails.
 *
 * BOUNDED INPUT
 * -------------
 * - Only the last SESSION_SUMMARIZATION_MAX_MESSAGES messages are included
 *   (CoachingSession path; no messages are read for the Conversation path).
 * - Session/conversation metadata is used for structured extraction.
 * - No full transcript is dumped; no raw message content is ever stored.
 *
 * PRIVACY
 * -------
 * - Neither derive function stores raw message content.
 * - session_summary is built from structured metadata fields only.
 * - The output is sanitized through the Phase 2 sanitizeSummaryRecord contract
 *   before any persistence.
 * - Forbidden fields (transcript, messages, etc.) are never included in output.
 *
 * FAIL-SAFE
 * ---------
 * - All errors in all trigger functions are caught.
 * - Summarization failure never propagates to the caller.
 * - The session/conversation UX is independent of these functions.
 *
 * This file contains no Deno APIs and no runtime side effects beyond async
 * functions that fire-and-forget. It is safe to import in Vitest unit tests
 * (the base44 dependency is only imported lazily inside the trigger functions).
 *
 * See docs/therapist-upgrade-stage2-plan.md — Phase 2.1 for CoachingSession context.
 * See Phase 4 for Chat.jsx conversation memory write context.

 *
 * APPROACH (non-LLM, deterministic)
 * - session_summary: constructed from session.focus_area + session.current_challenge
 *   + session.desired_outcome (structured metadata, not raw transcript).
 * - follow_up_tasks: extracted from incomplete action_plan items.
 * - actions: extracted from completed action_plan items.
 * - goals_referenced: extracted from session.related_goals.
 * - interventions_used: derived from session.stage.
 * - All other clinical arrays: empty (not guessable without LLM).
 * - Message window: used to bound input scope; message content is NOT stored.
 *
 * The output is passed through sanitizeSummaryRecord to enforce the Phase 2
 * contract before any downstream use.
 *
 * @param {object} session
 *   A CoachingSession entity. Must have at minimum: { id, stage }.
 *   Optional enrichment: focus_area, current_challenge, desired_outcome,
 *   action_plan, related_goals, created_date.
 * @param {Array} [messages=[]]
 *   Conversation messages from the session (bounded to SESSION_SUMMARIZATION_MAX_MESSAGES).
 *   Message content is NOT stored in the output — only the window size is used.

 * - Only structured entity fields are read (id, title, status for Goal;
 *   core_belief for CaseFormulation). No message content is accessed.
 * - Goal and CaseFormulation are approved read-only entities in the CBT

 * - The enriched payload is sanitized through sanitizeSummaryRecord before

 * - Any entity read failure returns the base payload unchanged.
 * - The caller's write path is never blocked by an enrichment failure.

 * - Only called when isContinuityEnrichmentEnabled() is true.
 * - The companion flow is never affected: this function is only called from
 *   triggerConversationEndSummarization (the therapist-only write path).

 *   The record returned by deriveConversationMemoryPayload. Must not be mutated

/**
 * Triggers a non-blocking memory write for a Chat.jsx free-form therapy
 * conversation end.
 *
 * Phase 4 — Chat.jsx Conversation Memory Write.
 *
 * Called from Chat.jsx's requestSummary function — the explicit end-of-chat
 * boundary where a user signals they want a session summary. This is a
 * natural, deliberate session-completion surface that fires at most once per
 * conversation (since users typically request summaries once per session).
 *
 * The call is:
 *   - Gated: checks isSummarizationEnabled() first; returns immediately if false.
 *   - Non-blocking: fires-and-forgets; the Chat.jsx UI is never awaited or blocked.
 *   - Safe: all errors are caught; the summary request UX is unaffected.
 *   - Inert in default mode: when flags are off, this function is a no-op.
 *   - Privacy-preserving: no message content is read or stored.
 *
 * WHY THIS MATTERS (Phase 4 gap closure)
 * Chat.jsx's V7 session-start path (buildV7SessionStartContentAsync) reads
 * CompanionMemory for cross-session continuity, but Chat.jsx conversations
 * previously had no path to write to CompanionMemory. This function closes
 * that gap: once a user requests a session summary, a minimal memory record is
 * written, giving V7 something to read in future sessions.
 *
 * Phase 3 Deep Personalization extends this write path:
 * When `entities` is provided AND isContinuityEnrichmentEnabled() is true,
 * the base payload is enriched with Goal + CaseFormulation data before persistence.
 * The enrichment is fail-closed: any read failure leaves the base payload intact.
 *
 * @param {string} conversationId - The Base44 conversation ID.
 * @param {object} [conversationMeta={}] - The conversation's metadata object.
 * @param {string} [invoker=CONVERSATION_END_SUMMARY_INVOKER] - Diagnostic label.
 * @param {object} [entities=null]
 *   Optional Base44 entity client map (base44.entities from Chat.jsx).
 *   When provided and isContinuityEnrichmentEnabled() is true, the payload is
 *   enriched with Goal and CaseFormulation data before persistence.
