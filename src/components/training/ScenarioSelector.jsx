    difficulty: 'Medium',
    tags: ['panic', 'grounding', 'psychoeducation'],
    description: 'A patient is in the middle of an acute panic attack, convinced they are dying. They are hyperventilating and catastrophizing.',
    patientProfile: `Name: Alex, 28 years old. First panic attack 3 months ago. Has since developed health anxiety and avoids exercise, caffeine, and crowded places for fear of triggering another attack. Currently in acute distress — heart racing, dizzy, convinced something is medically wrong. Has been to the ER twice; all clear. Knows intellectually it's "just anxiety" but cannot shake the terror.`,
    openingMessage: "I can't breathe properly. My heart is pounding. I think I'm having a heart attack again. I know you're going to say it's just anxiety but it doesn't FEEL like just anxiety, I'm genuinely scared right now.",

    id: 'social_anxiety_avoidance',
    title: 'Social Anxiety & Avoidance',
    difficulty: 'Medium',
    tags: ['social anxiety', 'avoidance', 'exposure'],
    description: 'A patient with severe social anxiety is justifying why they cancelled yet another social engagement.',
    patientProfile: `Name: Maya, 34 years old. Severe social anxiety for 10 years. Has been declining invitations, eating lunch alone, and recently turned down a promotion that would require team presentations. Core fear: being judged as stupid or incompetent. Engages in heavy pre- and post-event processing. Uses alcohol to cope at unavoidable social events. Insight is good but motivation to change is low — avoidance works in the short term.`,
    openingMessage: "I cancelled the dinner again. I know what you're going to say. But honestly the anxiety of going was worse than the anxiety of staying home. I texted them I was sick. I feel terrible about lying but also… relieved? Is that bad?",

    id: 'depression_behavioral_activation',
    title: 'Depression & Withdrawal',
    difficulty: 'Hard',
    tags: ['depression', 'behavioral activation', 'hopelessness'],
    description: 'A patient with moderate depression who is stuck in a withdrawal loop, convinced nothing will help.',
    patientProfile: `Name: Sam, 41 years old. Moderate depression for 2 years following a divorce. Has stopped exercising, cooking, seeing friends, and pursuing hobbies. Sleep is disrupted. Work performance declining. Core belief: "Nothing I do matters, I'm just going through the motions." Has tried antidepressants (partial response). Skeptical of CBT — has been to therapy twice before and says it "didn't work." Comes to sessions but is passive and gives minimal responses.`,
    openingMessage: "Another week, nothing changed. I know you want me to do the activity scheduling thing but I just… didn't. What's the point? I'll probably just feel terrible while doing whatever it is and then feel terrible afterward too.",

    difficulty: 'Hard',
    tags: ['OCD', 'ERP', 'reassurance', 'exposure'],
    description: 'A patient with contamination OCD seeking reassurance the therapist must not provide.',
    patientProfile: `Name: Jordan, 22 years old. Contamination OCD. Washes hands 30-50 times per day, avoids public restrooms, cannot touch door handles. Spends 3-4 hours daily in cleaning rituals. Academic performance severely impacted. Has googled "can you get sick from touching X" hundreds of times. Core fear: being responsible for getting someone they love sick. Is seeking reassurance in session — wants therapist to confirm the feared item was "probably clean."`,
    openingMessage: "Okay so I touched the handrail on the way in and I've been spiraling since. I washed my hands three times in your bathroom already. I just need to know — if the handrail had some kind of pathogen on it, would I definitely have already washed it off? Like, can you just reassure me that it's fine?",

    difficulty: 'Hard',
    tags: ['trauma', 'avoidance', 'psychoeducation', 'pacing'],
    description: 'A trauma survivor who is intellectually aware but resistant to engaging with trauma memories.',
    patientProfile: `Name: Riley, 38 years old. Single-incident trauma (car accident 2 years ago). Avoids driving, highways, news about accidents. Has nightmares 3x/week. Hypervigilant in cars. Has built elaborate life around avoidance — moved closer to work, partners do all the driving. Knows avoidance maintains PTSD but finds the prospect of processing "the event" terrifying. Uses intellectualization as a defense — talks about trauma in third-person clinical terms to avoid emotional engagement.`,
    openingMessage: "I've been reading about EMDR and trauma-focused CBT. Intellectually I understand the avoidance is the problem. I can explain the neuroscience of it. But every time we get close to actually talking about that day, I just… shut down. My mind goes blank. Can we just do more psychoeducation today instead?",

    description: 'A patient with generalized anxiety disorder who ruminates excessively and seeks certainty.',
    patientProfile: `Name: Dana, 45 years old. GAD for most of adult life. Worries about health, finances, children's safety, job security — everything. Lies awake at night running through catastrophic scenarios. Insight: "I know I'm a worrier." Core belief: "Worrying keeps me prepared." Has tried meditation (didn't stick). Responds well to CBT but keeps finding new worries to replace old ones. Currently in a worry spiral about an upcoming medical test result (routine, but Dana has convinced herself it will be bad news).`,
    openingMessage: "I'm still waiting for my test results and I can't stop thinking about it. I know the doctor said it was routine but then why did she order it? What if she saw something? I've been googling my symptoms for days. I know I shouldn't but I can't help it.",
