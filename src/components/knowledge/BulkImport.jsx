    content: "Worry postponement is a CBT technique for GAD in which clients schedule a specific 20–30 minute 'worry period' each day. When worry intrudes outside this window, the client notes the worry and postpones engaging with it until the scheduled time. This breaks the pattern of uncontrolled rumination throughout the day and teaches that worry can be deferred. During the scheduled period, the client engages with worries actively, often using problem-solving or cognitive restructuring. Research shows this reduces overall worry frequency and distress.",

    content: "Marlatt and Gordon's relapse prevention model identifies high-risk situations as the primary precipitants of relapse. Categories include: negative emotional states (35%); interpersonal conflict (16%); social pressure (20%). Clients are taught to: identify their personal high-risk situations using functional analysis; develop coping plans for each; distinguish between a lapse (single episode) and relapse (return to full pattern); use the abstinence violation effect (AVE) reframe to prevent a lapse escalating to relapse. Lifestyle balance — ensuring sufficient positive reinforcement activities — reduces overall vulnerability to high-risk situations.",

    content: "CBT for bipolar disorder (CBT-BD) begins with psychoeducation about the biological basis of the condition, the role of triggers in episode onset, and the importance of medication adherence. Mood monitoring using daily life charts (recording mood, sleep, activity, and medication) helps clients and therapists identify early warning signs (prodromal symptoms) of manic and depressive episodes. Action plans specify what to do at each level of mood escalation. CBT-BD also addresses schema-level beliefs about hypomanic states ('I need to be high to be productive') that create ambivalence about mood stability.",

BEs are more powerful than thought challenging alone because they generate experiential disconfirmation. Steps: (1) identify the belief to test and rate conviction; (2) design an experiment that directly tests the prediction; (3) identify potential obstacles and plan safeguards; (4) carry out the experiment; (5) review results and update the belief rating. Types include: active experiments (doing something different), survey experiments (asking others), and observational experiments (paying systematic attention). BEs are the engine of schema change.",
