/**
 * Normalization edge-case tests for the crisis detection layer.
 *
 * These tests complement test/utils/crisisDetector.test.js by drilling into
 * three specific normalization dimensions for the client-side detector in
 * src/components/utils/crisisDetector.jsx:
 *
 *   1. Extra internal spaces between words within a crisis phrase
 *      (handled by the \s+ quantifier present in every CRISIS_PATTERN)
 *   2. Trailing punctuation at the end of a crisis phrase / message
 *      (the \b word-boundary anchor still fires before punctuation chars)
 *   3. ALL-CAPS phrases across all pattern families
 *      (all patterns carry the /i flag; normalization also lowercases before
 *      checking)
 *
 * Additionally, a "known non-detections" section locks in current behavior for
 * benign inputs that appear structurally similar to crisis phrases but must NOT
 * be flagged.  These cases only assert the current production behavior;
 * they do not represent a judgment on whether that behavior is ideal.
 *
 * Exports under test (same as crisisDetector.test.js):
 *   - detectCrisisLanguage(message) → boolean
 *   - detectCrisisWithReason(message) → null | reason_code
 *
 * Do NOT modify src/components/utils/crisisDetector.jsx.
 * If the production source changes, update this file to match and re-review.
