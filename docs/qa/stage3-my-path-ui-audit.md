# Stage 3 — My Path UI audit

Requested scope: My Path and its goals, progress, health, mood, starter-path and journey surfaces. Base: f7707d94af021fc955f4db59986b6fe395f4b2af, after merged #1036 and the owner's Base44 package update.

## Coverage and evidence

The isolated browser fixtures use synthetic records, intercept entity and AI requests, and never write production data. Widths: 360, 768 and 1440; phone/desktop heights 640–844 and tablet height 1024. The page matrix covers English/Hebrew, LTR/RTL and light/dark. Flows cover both languages at every width. Additional existing tests cover the original navigation and locale behavior.

| Surface | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| My Path | All three cards, layout, descriptions, existing destinations; Starter Path link also covered by existing navigation tests |
| Goals | Empty list, active/completed records, long titles/descriptions, manual entry from More actions, save and reload |
| Manual goal form | Basic/SMART/milestones, preserved values, nested category picker hit-testing and Escape, modal focus containment and return to opener, cancellation without writes |
| Goal Coach | All four steps, selected category, long title/motivation, milestone, back/forward preservation, visible save, submitted goal and return home |
| Goal details | Progress, milestones, chart, task board, linked journal panel, adjustment dialog, reminders and add-reminder fields |
| Goal calendar/timeline | Day markers, localized month/week controls, readable full day-event text, long goal titles and tablet filters |
| Templates | Localized catalog, category controls, open/close and keyboard focus |
| AI goal views | Suggestions and structured title/description, breakdown step/description, coaching results; presentation only, AI requests mocked |
| Progress | All six tabs, charts, achievements, goals, exercise activity, health, local progress-data panel and current insight panels |
| Health | Populated and partial fields, empty state, notice readability, chart, long data form, last input and cancellation |
| Mood Tracker | Overview, calendar, insights, data and empty states, detailed entry form and close |
| Starter Path | Personalization both steps and retained choices; daily intro, example, input, exact completed-day summary, stored day advancement and reload; day-seven final completion and return home |
| Journeys | Available/in-progress/completed tabs, detail, reflection, both steps, final completion and completed-card state |

## Findings addressed

- Goal, template, AI, reminder, health and mood overlays now use the existing focus-managed `PremiumDialog` instead of unmanaged overlay wrappers. Goal-tool styling retains one card scroller instead of conflicting nested viewport calculations. Escape and focus restoration are exercised.
- Goal dialogs are above app chrome and below nested selection drawers. Nested picker hit-testing is tested after its entrance animation.
- Goals exposes its existing manual form through More actions while preserving the existing AI/chat entry points.
- Starter Path's title and day indicator wrap on narrow screens; the previous English 360px layout expanded app content to 411px. Personalization uses theme tokens and keyboard-operable selected goal buttons.
- Starter Path completion preserves the day actually finished while the progress query advances. Previously completing day one could show “Day 2 Complete” and “tomorrow Day 3.” The themed summary resets the previous exercise's scroll and focuses its heading; phone bounds cover the whole card between the fixed bars. Day-seven final completion is tested separately.
- Long milestone timeline content and filters wrap on tablet; the previous 768px layout expanded content to 892px.
- Goal card/chart/AI panels and health notices use the established theme surfaces. Progress tooltips use themed surfaces. Remaining status colors identify categories or status rather than enclosing whole pages in a separate palette.
- Suggested-goal rows retain structured objects during rendering. The previous text-list normalizer discarded object fields, leaving blank titles/descriptions and an undefined category. Breakdown rows also retain descriptions and timing fields. Prompts, schemas and agent boundaries are unchanged.
- Calendar, task-board and reminder controls are localized in all seven supported languages. Calendar day selection makes full event titles available on touch screens.
- Due-today goal dates are distinct from overdue calendar dates; tested at evening/year boundaries and against incomplete dates.
- Mood trend and trigger charts fit their available width instead of enforcing 500–620px horizontal canvases; axes and tooltips use theme tokens.
- Empty or partial health series no longer display an unexplained empty chart.

## Live observations

The secure Google sign-in opened the owner's **admin account**, rather than the previously designated disposable QA user. Live work was limited to viewing My Path, empty Goals, templates, all Progress tabs, the health form, Journeys and an existing journey's detail, plus Mood Tracker. No records, reminders, exports, emails or live progression were created, changed or deleted. Saving/completion evidence in this report comes from isolated fixtures, not the admin account.

The original live goal/template/health overlays left keyboard focus on the background opening button; the implementation replaces those wrappers. Existing live journey detail already used the current dialog layout.

## Reachability boundaries

- Current My Path has Goals, Progress and Starter Path cards. Journeys is reached through Tools. Mood Tracker is also tested directly because it is explicitly included in the requested stage.
- `AdvancedAnalytics` has no incoming UI link found from these paths. `CoachingAnalytics` is linked from the separate Coach page. Neither is claimed as a visited My Path subpage.
- `HealthInsights`, `GoalTrackingPanel`/`EnhancedGoalCard`, and `SixStepGoalWizard` exist as source components but are not rendered by these current routes. Their existence is not evidence that users can open them.
- The current Goals page groups active/completed records; filtering is provided in templates and timeline views. No new AI, report or tracking capability was invented to fill a plan item.

## Verification status

Local expanded checks and required CI results are recorded in the pull request when complete. No skip/fixme is added, and mocked results do not substitute for production persistence verification.

The existing seven-language mobile-action test now expects four items instead of three because the manual goal action is intentionally exposed. It additionally checks that action's localized label, and retains all action-height, readable-caption, calendar activation, menu-dismissal and overflow checks. New Starter Path checks wait for account/path initialization and the completion heading before reading the takeaway; a repeated fixture string in the previous exercise is not evidence of completion. Mood closing is checked after the same focus, keyboard containment and viewport checks used for the other goal dialogs.

After owner review, merge and publication, verify the deployed changes using the designated QA user. Physical phone/tablet keyboard, rotation and native-browser behavior remain device checks, separate from viewport emulation.

**Stage 1 item 9 remains OPEN:** the deferred live save/network failure and retry scenario is not closed by any test here. The separate Stage 2 live consent/conversation work is also not closed by this stage.
