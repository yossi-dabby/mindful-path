## What Is the SuperCbtAgent?

The SuperCbtAgent is a planned opt-in upgrade path for the existing CBT Therapist agent
(`cbt_therapist`) that aims to provide:

- **Full multilingual CBT** in all 7 app languages: `en`, `he`, `es`, `fr`, `de`, `it`, `pt`
- **Dynamic CBT sub-protocol selection** (standard CBT, ACT-informed, DBT-skills, MBSR-adjacent, or schema-focused)
- **Super-session longitudinal context** spanning multiple prior sessions
- **Extended workflow orchestration** building on the Phase 3 workflow engine

It is **not** a new agent. It is an upgrade path for the same `cbt_therapist` agent,
composed on top of the existing Stage 2 V5 wiring.

## Safety Rules

The SuperCbtAgent follows all existing safety constraints without exception:

| Rule | Status |
|------|--------|
| All existing safety filters remain authoritative | ✅ Enforced |
| Crisis detection / risk panel / safety mode are unchanged | ✅ Enforced |
| No new entity access at scaffold time | ✅ Enforced |
| No changes to any existing wiring, flag, or routing | ✅ Enforced |
| Feature-flag gated, double-gated (master + super flag) | ✅ Planned |
| All changes additive and opt-in only | ✅ Enforced |

> See [`docs/copilot-safety-rules.md`](../copilot-safety-rules.md) for the master safety rule set.

## Current State (This PR)

This PR delivers **Task 2: Add Super CBT Agent Skeleton** from the six-task rollout plan:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lib/superCbtAgent.js` | Scaffold module — wiring config + feature descriptor |
| `test/utils/superCbtAgent.test.js` | Regression + inertia tests |
| `docs/super-agent/README.md` | This file — overview and roadmap |
| `docs/super-agent/architecture.md` | Composition approach |

**No existing file was modified.**

## Activation Plan (Future PRs)

Activation must follow this exact sequence:

1. **Task 3 — i18n pass (separate PR)**  
   Add all 7-language translation keys for any new SuperCbtAgent prompts and UI text.  
   No keys may be removed or altered — only additive.

2. **Task 4 — Features + Language integration (separate PR)**  
   Implement SuperCbtAgent logic. Add `SUPER_CBT_AGENT_ENABLED` to `featureFlags.js`.  
   Add the routing branch in `resolveTherapistWiring()`.  
   All logic must be opt-in (flag defaults to `false`).

3. **Task 5 — E2E tests (separate PR)**  
   Add Playwright / Vitest tests covering English + at least one other language.  
   All existing tests must continue to pass.

4. **Task 6 — Docs + activation guide (separate PR)**  
   Update this file and add step-by-step activation and monitoring guide.

5. **Activation (requires explicit human approval)**  
   Enable flags only after all tasks are complete, all tests pass, and a human
   reviewer has signed off.
