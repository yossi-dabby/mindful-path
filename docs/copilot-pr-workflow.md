# Copilot PR Workflow — Mindful Path CBT App

> **Workflow guidance for all contributors and Copilot-assisted PRs.**
> This document defines safe PR authoring, review, and merge expectations for this production-sensitive repository.
> See also: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `docs/copilot-safety-rules.md`.

## 0. Branch Targeting Policy (Staging-First)

**This is a critical rule that must be followed for all rollout/preparation PRs. Read it before opening any PR.**

| Branch | Purpose | Who merges to it |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Stable, Base44-connected production branch | Merges from `staging` only, after validation |
| `staging` | Rollout-validation branch for all preparation and feature work | All rollout/preparation PRs target here first |

### Rules

1. **All rollout and preparation PRs must target `staging`, not `main`.**
2. **`main` is the stable Base44-connected branch.** Direct pushes or PRs to `main` that bypass `staging` are not allowed for rollout/preparation work.
3. **Merge to `main` only after staging validation passes.** This means CI passes on `staging`, human review is complete, and the change has been confirmed safe in the staging environment.
4. **If you opened a PR against `main` by mistake**, close it and reopen it targeting `staging`. Do not merge it into `main` before it has gone through `staging`.

> **Copilot rule:** Always open PRs against `staging` for rollout/preparation tasks. Never open a rollout/preparation PR against `main`.

---

## 1. PR Size and Scope

- **One logical change per PR.** Do not bundle unrelated changes.
- **One risk domain per PR.** Do not mix UI changes with backend function changes, or entity changes with documentation changes.
- **Small diffs are safer diffs.** If a PR is touching more than 5–6 files, pause and consider splitting it.
- **Do not reformat unrelated code** in the same PR. Formatting changes obscure the real diff and make review harder.
- **Do not include build artifacts, generated files, or dependency folders** (`node_modules/`, `dist/`) in the commit.

---

## 2. Required Validation Before Merge

Every PR must pass the following checks before it is eligible for merge:

| Check | Command | Requirement |
|---|---|---|
| Lint | `npm run lint` | Zero errors |
| Unit tests | `npm test` | All tests pass (44+ tests) |
| Build | `npm run build` | Succeeds without errors or warnings |
| Type check | `npm run typecheck` | **Informational — currently non-blocking** (see `docs/typecheck-debt-baseline.md`) |
| E2E tests | `npm run test:e2e` | All tests pass (requires running app) |

For any change to `functions/`:
- Describe the expected behavior change clearly in the PR description.
- Propose or add corresponding unit or integration tests.
- Request a manual human review before merge.
- For changes to safety-critical filter files, also complete `docs/safety-filter-review-checklist.md`.

---

## 3. When Tests Are Mandatory

| Change Type | Test Requirement |
|---|---|
| New utility function | Unit test required |
| Bug fix in frontend | Unit or E2E test required |
| New page or component | E2E test strongly recommended |
| Backend function change | Unit or integration test required; human review required |
| i18n key addition | Verify all 7 language keys present in translations.jsx |
| Agent wiring change | Requires explicit human approval before any test is written |
| Entity schema change | Requires explicit human approval; must not be attempted without it |
| Safety filter change | Requires explicit human approval; must not proceed without it |

---

## 4. When a Human Must Review Manually

The following situations **always** require a human reviewer (not just automated CI):

1. Any change to `functions/postLlmSafetyFilter.ts`
2. Any change to `functions/sanitizeAgentOutput.ts`
3. Any change to `functions/sanitizeConversation.ts`
4. Any change to `src/api/agentWiring.js` or `src/api/activeAgentWiring.js`
5. Any change to `src/api/entities/` (entity schema definitions)
6. Any change to `functions/backfillKnowledgeIndex.ts` or retrieval/indexing logic
7. Any change that expands agent tool access or retrieval scope
8. Any change that could affect private user entity access
9. Any PR that touches files in more than one high-scrutiny group (see Section 7)
10. Any PR that the author is uncertain about

> **For safety-filter changes specifically**, complete the full checklist at `docs/safety-filter-review-checklist.md` before requesting review. That document includes scope identification, approval requirements, safety review questions, test expectations, risk classification, and merge guidance.

---

## 5. Which Paths Require Extra Caution

See Section 7 for the full high-scrutiny path registry. In addition:

- **`src/components/layout/`** — scroll container, AppContent. Changes here can break iOS scroll on all pages.
- **`src/components/i18n/translations.jsx`** — all UI strings in 7 languages; a missing key in one language degrades UX.
- **`src/Layout.jsx`** — app shell; breaks are visible to all users.
- **`functions/checkProactiveNudges.ts`** — automated nudge logic; errors reach real users.
- **`functions/retentionCleanup.ts`** — deletes data; irreversible; must not be modified without approval.

---

## 6. Paths That Should Be Docs/Tests-Only Unless Explicitly Approved

| Path | Safe Actions Without Approval | Actions Requiring Explicit Approval |
|---|---|---|
| `functions/` | Add tests, add inline comments | Any logic change |
| `src/api/entities/` | Read/reference only | Any field, type, or schema change |
| `src/api/agentWiring.js` | Read/reference only | Any change |
| `src/api/activeAgentWiring.js` | Read/reference only | Any change |
| `functions/backfillKnowledgeIndex.ts` | Read/reference only | Any change |
| `functions/postLlmSafetyFilter.ts` | Read/reference only | Any change |
| `functions/sanitizeAgentOutput.ts` | Read/reference only | Any change |
| `functions/sanitizeConversation.ts` | Read/reference only | Any change |
| `src/components/layout/` | Read/reference only | Any change |
| `src/Layout.jsx` | Read/reference only | Any change |

## 7. High-Scrutiny Path Registry

### 🔴 SAFETY-CRITICAL — Never Change Without Explicit Human Approval

| Path / File | Why It Is High Scrutiny | What Must Be Validated | Copilot Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `functions/postLlmSafetyFilter.ts` | Filters LLM output for safety; weakening it harms vulnerable users | Manual logic review; confirm filter rules are not loosened | DO NOT change without explicit approval |
| `functions/sanitizeAgentOutput.ts` | Sanitizes agent responses; removing sanitization harms users | Manual logic review; no relaxation of sanitization rules | DO NOT change without explicit approval |
| `functions/sanitizeConversation.ts` | Sanitizes conversation content; removing sanitization harms users | Manual logic review; confirm sanitization rules preserved | DO NOT change without explicit approval |
| `src/api/agentWiring.js` | Wires CBT Therapist and Companion agents to data sources | Confirm no new entity access added; confirm no tool expansion | DO NOT change without explicit approval |
| `src/api/activeAgentWiring.js` | Active agent runtime wiring; changes alter live AI behavior | Same as agentWiring.js | DO NOT change without explicit approval |
| `src/api/entities/` | Base44 entity schemas; any schema change breaks the live runtime | Schema diff review; migration plan required | DO NOT change without explicit approval |

---

### 🔴 RETRIEVAL/INDEXING — Never Change Without Explicit Human Approval

| Path / File | Why It Is High Scrutiny | What Must Be Validated | Copilot Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `functions/backfillKnowledgeIndex.ts` | Populates the knowledge index; changes corrupt the knowledge base | Full regression of retrieval pipeline before merge | DO NOT change without explicit approval |
| Any retrieval or indexing function in `functions/` | Retrieval scope expansion risks exposing private user data | Confirm private entities are not added to retrieval pipeline | DO NOT change without explicit approval |

---

### 🔴 APP SHELL / LAYOUT — Never Change Without Explicit Human Approval

| Path / File | Why It Is High Scrutiny | What Must Be Validated | Copilot Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/Layout.jsx` | App shell visible to all users; scroll/viewport conventions are fragile | iOS scroll regression test; visual review | DO NOT change without explicit approval |
| `src/components/layout/AppContent.jsx` | Main scroll container (`#app-scroll-container`); must use `overflow-x-clip` not `overflow-x-hidden` | iOS/Android scroll regression | DO NOT change without explicit approval |
| `src/App.jsx` | Route definitions and auth flow; changes affect all pages | All E2E tests must pass | DO NOT change without explicit approval |

---

### 🟠 MEDIUM SCRUTINY — Backend Functions (Non-Safety-Critical)

| Path / File | Why It Is High Scrutiny | What Must Be Validated | Copilot Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `functions/checkProactiveNudges.ts` | Nudges reach real users; errors or misfires cause harm | Unit tests + logic review | Human review required; add tests |
| `functions/retentionCleanup.ts` | Deletes user data permanently; irreversible | Logic review; confirm scope of deletion unchanged | Human review required |
| Other files in `functions/` | Production backend; errors affect live users | Unit tests required; behavior documented in PR | Human review recommended |

---

### 🟠 MEDIUM SCRUTINY — UI / Navigation / i18n

| Path / File | Why It Is High Scrutiny | What Must Be Validated | Copilot Rule |
|---|---|---|---|
| `src/pages/` | Route-level pages; changes affect user flows | E2E test must pass; no broken routes | Explicit request required |
| `src/components/layout/` | Layout components shared by all pages | iOS scroll regression; visual review | Explicit request required |
| `src/components/i18n/translations.jsx` | All 7 language strings; missing key degrades UX | Confirm all 7 language sections updated | Always update all 7 languages |
| `src/Layout.jsx` | See above | See above | DO NOT change without explicit approval |

---

### 🟡 LOWER SCRUTINY — Safe to Change With Tests

| Path / File | Notes |
|---|---|
| `src/components/` (non-layout) | Bug fixes or new components by request; must follow scroll/viewport conventions |
| `src/utils/`, `src/lib/`, `src/hooks/` | Pure utilities; must have no side effects; unit tests required |
| `test/`, `tests/` | Additive tests only; must not remove or weaken existing tests |
| `docs/` | Additive documentation only; must not remove existing policy docs |
| `README.md` | Additive updates only |

---

## 8. Describing Assumptions in PR Descriptions

Every PR description should include:

1. **What changed**: A plain-English summary of what was modified and why.
2. **Assumptions made**: Any assumption about how a function, entity, or agent works that you could not directly verify.
3. **Safety impact**: A clear statement of whether this change could affect safety-critical paths, private entity access, or agent behavior — and why it does or does not.
4. **What was tested**: Which commands were run and whether they passed.
5. **What was NOT tested**: If any test category was skipped, explain why.
6. **Approval needed**: Whether this PR requires human review before merge, and why.

---

## 9. Documenting Safety Impact

When writing a PR description, include a **Safety Impact** section:

```markdown
## Safety Impact
- Does this change affect any safety-critical file? [Yes / No]
  - If yes: which file, and why the change is safe.
- Does this change expand retrieval scope? [Yes / No]
  - If yes: which entities are now accessible, and why this is approved.
- Does this change affect private user entity access? [Yes / No]
- Does this change alter agent tool access? [Yes / No]
- Does this change affect any UI, route, or navigation? [Yes / No]
```

If the answer to any question is **Yes**, a human reviewer must sign off before merge.

---

## 10. Code Review Expectations for Copilot-Assisted PRs

When reviewing a Copilot-assisted PR, the reviewer should check for:

| Risk | What to Look For |
|---|---|
| **Runtime safety** | Does the change affect execution paths in safety-critical functions? |
| **Retrieval scope expansion** | Does the change add any new entity to a retrieval or indexing pipeline? |
| **Private entity access** | Does the change read, write, or index ThoughtJournal, Conversation, CaseFormulation, MoodEntry, CompanionMemory, or UserDeletedConversations at a shared level? |
| **Accidental UI or route changes** | Does the change affect pages, routes, layout, or navigation? |
| **Secret exposure** | Does the change log, expose, or bundle any credential, token, or API key? |
| **Agent tool expansion** | Does the change add new tools to any AI agent? |
| **Therapist/coach boundary drift** | Does the change expand the CBT Therapist's emotional support role beyond clinical boundaries? |
| **Regression test coverage** | For backend function changes: is there a test that covers the changed logic? |
| **Overly large PR** | Is the PR touching more than one risk domain? Should it be split? |
| **Safety-critical file modification** | Is any file from the 🔴 HIGH SCRUTINY list modified? Does it have explicit approval? |

## 12. Playwright / E2E Test Guardrails

These rules apply to every PR that adds or modifies Playwright E2E tests.
They exist to prevent the recurring failure patterns documented in the
stabilization sprint (PR-8).

### Required rules

1. **Use narrow route mocks.**
   Register `page.route()` handlers with the smallest URL pattern that covers
   only the endpoints your test requires.  Use the exported
   `SAFE_CONVERSATION_ROUTE_PATTERNS` constants from `tests/helpers/ui.ts` for
   Chat conversation endpoints.

2. **Do not mock static assets.**
   PDF files, form assets, images, and fonts in `public/` must resolve as real
   static files in tests.  Mocking them hides missing-asset regressions.

3. **Prefer stable `data-testid` / role / DOM-state assertions.**
   Locate elements by `data-testid`, ARIA role, or semantic attribute rather
   than by text content alone.  Text content is more likely to change.

4. **Do not rely only on echoed user text.**
   Form-router-enriched prompts may not render a visible user bubble in Chat.
   Wait for `POST /messages` and input reset; do not assert echoed user text
   as the sole success condition.

5. **Assert behavior, not only text.**
   Confirm that the correct component rendered, the correct action occurred, or
   the correct data attribute is present — not just that some string is visible.

6. **Inspect Playwright artifacts before changing failing tests.**
   When a CI E2E test fails, download the artifacts (screenshots, trace, error
   context) from the GitHub Actions run before modifying the test.  Understand
   what actually happened; do not adjust timeouts or selectors blindly.

7. **Do not weaken assertions to make CI pass.**
   A failing test is a signal.  Fix the root cause, not the assertion.

8. **If the mock is wrong, fix the mock — not the assertion.**
   If a test fails because the product behavior is correct but the mock returns
   stale or incorrect data, fix the mock to match the real contract.

9. **If a test reveals a real product bug, fix it in a separate focused PR.**
   Unless the current PR's scope explicitly allows production code changes,
   open a new PR to fix the product behavior rather than weakening the test.

10. **Treat local Playwright browser install failure as an environment limit.**
    The GitHub Actions Playwright run is authoritative.  A local browser-not-
    found error does not mean the test is broken or that CI will fail.

11. **Keep PR descriptions synchronized with the final diff.**
    If the implementation diverges from what was originally described, update
    the PR description before requesting review.  A stale description misleads
    reviewers.

12. **Keep test-only PRs test-only.**
    Do not include production code changes in a test-only PR unless a proven
    minimal helper fix is required and documented.

### Anti-patterns to avoid

| Anti-pattern | Why it is dangerous |
|---|---|
| `page.route('**/*')` without strong justification | Intercepts ALL requests, including static assets and Vite module scripts |
| Mocked `GET` replacing `POST`-created conversation state | Causes `safeUpdateMessages` guards to block Chat rendering |
| `generated_file`-only mock for a multi-form scenario | Hides the `generated_files` contract; multi-card rendering is not verified |
| `expect(cardCount).toBeGreaterThan(0)` for a known multi-form contract | Passes with 1 card when 2+ are expected; use an exact count assertion |
| `test.skip` or `test.fixme` as a stabilization shortcut | Removes a regression gate silently; fix the underlying issue instead |
| Screenshots-only or text-only assertions for behavior | Does not verify that the correct component rendered or action occurred |
| Stale PR body that contradicts the code diff | Misleads reviewers about what actually changed |
| `waitForTimeout` without a justification comment | Hides flakiness and makes tests slow without a documented reason |

### Guardrail test coverage

`test/utils/playwrightMockGuardrails.test.js` enforces a subset of the above
rules with static source-contract checks that run as part of the unit test
suite (`npm test`).  If you add a new E2E spec or modify `tests/helpers/ui.ts`,
confirm that all guardrail tests still pass.
