# Staging Deployment Guide

> **Status: Preparation only.**
> Stage 2 flags are NOT enabled. App behavior is unchanged.
> This document describes how an external staging deployment must be configured
> so that Stage 2 flag enablement can be validated safely outside Base44 preview.

---

## 1. Branch Strategy

| Branch    | Purpose                                           | Base44 status         |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `main`    | Stable production branch — Base44 source of truth | Active (do not touch) |
| `staging` | Rollout-validation branch — external staging only  | Separate from Base44  |

**Key rule:** `staging` is intentionally separate from `main`. Changes merged to
`staging` do not affect Base44 production until they are explicitly merged to `main`.

---

## 2. Platform

This app is a **Vite + React SPA** backed by the **Base44 SDK**. There is no
server-side runtime. The build output is a static bundle served from any static
hosting provider.

No specific deployment platform is prescribed. The build and serve commands are:

```bash
# Production-style build (set env vars before running)
npm run build

# Preview the built bundle locally
npm run preview          # serves on http://localhost:4173
```

---

## 3. Required Environment Variables — Staging

All `VITE_*` variables are **build-time only**. They must be set in the build
environment (CI secrets, platform build settings) **before** `npm run build`
runs. They are baked into the static bundle at build time and cannot be changed
at runtime without a rebuild.

### 3.1 Core App Variables (Required)

| Variable                       | Type        | Description                                                  | Staging value         |
|-------------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `VITE_BASE44_APP_ID`           | Build-time  | Base44 application identifier. Must match the staging app.  | Set to staging app ID |
| `VITE_BASE44_FUNCTIONS_VERSION`| Build-time  | Base44 functions version to use.                            | Omit or set explicitly |
| `BASE44_APP_ID`                | Build-time  | Fallback if `VITE_BASE44_APP_ID` is absent.                 | Set to staging app ID |
| `BASE44_FUNCTIONS_VERSION`     | Build-time  | Fallback if `VITE_BASE44_FUNCTIONS_VERSION` is absent.      | Omit or set explicitly |

### 3.2 Stage 2 Feature Flag Variables (Frontend, Build-time)

All flags default to `false` when the variable is absent or any value other than
`'true'`. The current default therapist path is always active when all flags are
`false`.

> **Do NOT enable any of these flags until Phase 9 exit criteria are met.**
> See `docs/therapist-upgrade-stage2-plan.md §Phase 9`.

| Variable                                                  | Phase            | Description                                          | Staging default |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_ENABLED`                          | Gate             | Master rollback switch for all Stage 2 behavior      | `false`         |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_MEMORY_ENABLED`                   | 1                | Structured therapist memory layer                    | `false`         |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_SUMMARIZATION_ENABLED`            | 2                | Session-end structured summarization (client gate)   | `false`         |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_WORKFLOW_ENABLED`                 | 3                | Therapist workflow engine                            | `false`         |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_TRUSTED_INGESTION_ENABLED`        | 4                | External trusted knowledge ingestion                 | `false`         |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_RETRIEVAL_ORCHESTRATION_ENABLED`  | 5                | Internal-first retrieval orchestration               | `false`         |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_ALLOWLIST_WRAPPER_ENABLED`        | 6                | Live retrieval allowlist wrapper                     | `false`         |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_SAFETY_MODE_ENABLED`              | 7                | Safety mode + emergency resource layer               | `false`         |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_FORMULATION_CONTEXT_ENABLED`      | Phase 1 Quality  | Case formulation context injection at session start (V6 wiring) | `false` |
| `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_CONTINUITY_ENABLED`               | Phase 3 Deep     | Cross-session memory continuity injection at session start (V7 wiring, superset of V6) | `false` |

> **Flag dependency for continuity read path:**
> `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_CONTINUITY_ENABLED` activates the **read** path (session-start injection from CompanionMemory).
> For that data to exist, `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_SUMMARIZATION_ENABLED` must also be enabled (and the matching
> backend Base44 secret — see Section 3.4) so that memory write operations can populate CompanionMemory.
> Enabling only the read flag without the write flag is safe (fail-closed: no data → empty block), but the
> therapist will have no prior session context to inject until at least one write has completed.

> **Phase 3 enrichment (conversation memory write enrichment):**
> When _both_ `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_SUMMARIZATION_ENABLED` and `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_CONTINUITY_ENABLED`
> are `true`, Chat.jsx session-end memory writes are automatically enriched with active Goal records
> (→ `goals_referenced`, `follow_up_tasks`) and the most recent CaseFormulation (→ `working_hypotheses`)
> before persistence. This produces richer cross-session continuity context for the next session start.
> No additional flag is required — the enrichment reuses the two existing flags.
> Enrichment is fail-closed: any entity read failure leaves the base payload unchanged.

### 3.3 Build Behavior Variables (CI/CD)

| Variable                      | Type        | Description                                              | Staging value |
|-------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `CI`                          | Build-time  | Enables sourcemaps and disables minification in CI builds | `true`        |
| `BASE44_LEGACY_SDK_IMPORTS`   | Build-time  | Enable legacy Base44 SDK import paths (default: `false`) | `false`       |

### 3.4 Backend Runtime Secrets (Base44 Application Secrets)

These are **not** VITE build-time variables. They are set in the **Base44 Application Secrets** panel
and are read by Deno backend functions at request time via `Deno.env.get()`.

The frontend `VITE_*` flags gate the client-side trigger; the backend secrets gate the Deno execution.
Both must be `true` for a full memory write to succeed.

| Secret name                              | Read by Deno function            | Purpose                                                   | Local / Preview | Staging | Production |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|---------|------------|
| `THERAPIST_UPGRADE_MEMORY_ENABLED`       | `retrieveTherapistMemory`        | Gates per-user structured memory retrieval                | `false`         | `false` | `false`    |
| `THERAPIST_UPGRADE_SUMMARIZATION_ENABLED`| `generateSessionSummary`         | Gates session-end memory write to CompanionMemory         | `false`         | `false` | `false`    |

> **Important:** `THERAPIST_UPGRADE_CONTINUITY_ENABLED` and
> `THERAPIST_UPGRADE_FORMULATION_CONTEXT_ENABLED` are **frontend-only** VITE flags.
> They have no backend Deno equivalent. The V7 read path (`readCrossSessionContinuity`)
> reads CompanionMemory directly via the entity SDK — it does not call a backend function.

> **Recommended initial values** (all environments): `false` — do not enable until the
> Phase 9 exit criteria described in `docs/therapist-upgrade-stage2-plan.md` are met.

---

## 4. Runtime URL Overrides (Staging / Preview Hosts Only)

The app includes a **safe runtime override layer** for recognised
preview/staging hosts. This allows flags to be enabled without a rebuild,
which is useful for iterative staging validation.

**Recognised hosts where overrides are active:**
- `localhost`
- `127.0.0.1`
- `*.base44.app`
- `base44.app`

**URL override format:**
```
https://<staging-host>/?_s2=FLAG1,FLAG2,...
```

**Example — enable master gate and memory phase on a Base44 staging host:**
```
https://myapp.base44.app/?_s2=THERAPIST_UPGRADE_ENABLED,THERAPIST_UPGRADE_MEMORY_ENABLED
```

**Safety rules:**
- Unrecognised hosts (including any custom production domain) are **always
  fail-closed** — overrides are silently ignored.
- Overrides can only **enable** flags (set to `true`). They cannot disable a
  flag that was enabled at build time.
- Unknown flag names are silently ignored.

**Diagnostic mode** (shows unified flag evaluation state for both Therapist and Companion in the browser console):
```
https://<staging-host>/?_s2debug=true
```

This opens two console groups:
- `[Activation Diagnostics]` — Phase 4 unified surface covering Therapist (10 flags) + Companion (3 flags), with `routeHint` for each agent.
- `[S2 Diagnostics]` — Legacy therapist-only group (unchanged, retained for compatibility).

> **Note:** If the external staging deployment uses a custom domain that is NOT
> a `*.base44.app` subdomain, URL overrides will not be active on that host.
> In that case, all staging flag enablement must be done via build-time env vars
> (`VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_*`).

## 5. How Staging Remains Separate From Base44 / main

1. **Branch isolation:** The `staging` branch is not merged to `main` without
   explicit review. Base44 always pulls from `main`.

2. **App ID isolation:** Use a separate `VITE_BASE44_APP_ID` for the staging
   deployment. Do not point the staging build at the production Base44 app.

3. **Flag defaults:** All Stage 2 flags default to `false` at build time. The
   production build on `main` is unaffected by anything done on `staging`.

4. **CI separation:** GitHub Actions workflows run independently on `staging`
   pushes and PRs. A failing staging CI run does not block `main`.

5. **No runtime routing changes:** The app does not change its Base44 routing
   or auth based on the environment. The only staging-specific behavior is
   flag evaluation.

## 6. Stage 2 Verification Steps (How to Validate in Staging)

These steps verify that Stage 2 flag infrastructure is working correctly in the
external staging environment, **without enabling any Stage 2 behavior in
production**.

### Step 1 — Verify flag system is wired (all flags off)

1. Deploy the `staging` branch with all `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_*` and
   `VITE_COMPANION_UPGRADE_*` vars absent (or explicitly set to `false`).
2. Open the app on the staging host.
3. Add `?_s2debug=true` to the URL.
4. Open the browser console.
5. Confirm the `[Activation Diagnostics]` output shows (Phase 4 unified check):
   - `[Therapist]` section: `masterGateOn: false`, `routeHint: 'HYBRID (master gate off)'`, all flags `false`
   - `[Companion]` section: `masterGateOn: false`, `routeHint: 'HYBRID (master gate off)'`, all flags `false`

### Step 2 — Verify URL override layer (on recognised staging host only)

1. Add `?_s2=THERAPIST_UPGRADE_ENABLED&_s2debug=true` to the staging URL.
2. Confirm the `[Activation Diagnostics]` `[Therapist]` section shows:
   - `masterGateOn: true`
   - `routeHint: 'HYBRID (master gate on, no phase flag matched)'`
   - `THERAPIST_UPGRADE_ENABLED: true` in `computedFlags`
   - All per-phase therapist flags remain `false`
3. Confirm the `[Companion]` section is **unchanged** (all flags still `false`).

### Step 2b — Verify Companion URL override layer

1. Add `?_c2=COMPANION_UPGRADE_ENABLED&_s2debug=true` to the staging URL.
2. Confirm the `[Activation Diagnostics]` `[Companion]` section shows:
   - `masterGateOn: true`
   - `routeHint: 'HYBRID (master gate on, no phase flag matched)'`
   - `COMPANION_UPGRADE_ENABLED: true` in `computedFlags`
3. Confirm the `[Therapist]` section is **unchanged** (all flags still `false`).

### Step 3 — Verify build-time flag injection

1. Rebuild the staging deployment with
   `VITE_THERAPIST_UPGRADE_ENABLED=true` set in the build environment.
2. Add `?_s2debug=true` to the URL (no `_s2` param needed).
3. Confirm in the `[Therapist]` section:
   - `masterGateOn: true`
   - `THERAPIST_UPGRADE_ENABLED: true` in `computedFlags`
4. Confirm the `[Companion]` section remains all `false`.

> **Stop here.** Do not enable per-phase flags until the Phase 9 exit criteria
> in `docs/therapist-upgrade-stage2-plan.md` are confirmed complete.

## 7. CI on the staging Branch

The following workflows run automatically on every push to `staging` and on
every pull request targeting `staging`:

| Workflow              | File                                   | What it validates                           |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Test Suite            | `.github/workflows/webpack.yml`        | Unit tests + Vite build (Node 20 and 22)    |
| Playwright E2E Tests  | `.github/workflows/playwright.yml`     | Smoke tests + web-desktop + mobile-390x844  |

CI on `staging` is non-blocking for `main`. A failing `staging` CI run does not
prevent merges to `main`.

---

## 8. What Must NOT Be Changed to Enable Staging

The following are **frozen** regardless of staging work. Do not modify them as
part of staging deployment preparation:

- `src/api/entities/` — Base44 entity schemas
- `src/api/agentWiring.js` — Agent wiring configuration
- `src/api/activeAgentWiring.js` — Active agent routing
- `src/api/base44Client.js` — SDK client configuration
- `functions/` — Production backend functions
- Any Stage 2 flag values in `src/lib/featureFlags.js`
- Any therapist prompt or agent instruction
